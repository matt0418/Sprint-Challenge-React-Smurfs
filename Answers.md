1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Server side routing is where when a link is clicked, a request is made to the server for the new page. This allows for the delivering of data that is needed, no more. It is also the most optimized for search engines. However, a full page refresh is needed and there could be quite a bit of time required to wait for the new page to load.

Client Side routing is where routing is handled internally by javascript. It loads the entire webpage first which may make initial request for the site longer, but switching between views when clicking on links will appear much faster and have more smooth transitions.
